== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will new features be added? =

Yes, we will make changes to the diplay from time to time. These changes will appear automatically on your blog.

= Why is there so much "inline" CSS displayed in my NCAAF D1AA Stats table? =

We decided to use inline CSS to display the stats table, in order to comply with W3C markup standards as much as possible. The only other alternative 
would be to embed a new stylesheet, however this does not meet W3C standards. Any other ideas from users are welcome!

= My sidebar (or part of my sidebar) disappeared after I installed this plugin, what happened? =

This problem arises from the coding of your WP template. In some cases, the PHP code that calls the blog's sidebar and sidebar objects 
is placed in the wrong spot on the page. In order to remedy this, visit the following link: http://cutline.tubetorial.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8596 . The fix 
takes 5 minutes or less to complete.
